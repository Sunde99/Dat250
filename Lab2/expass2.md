## Technical Problems:
I had problems running the main file as my derby was too old. 
Intellj said it had the latest version, yet it was outdated. 
Turned out I had the 2019 version, so it couldn't find the 10.15 version.
Once I updated Intellj it worked fine.

## The Database
I inspected the database by looking at the database tool window in Intellj

## Pending Issues
I believe I did everything, however, I feel the tutorial was unclear, and it differing from the pulled project did not make it easier.

## Tables
Here are some pictures
